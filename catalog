description:	c2man is an automatic documentation tool that extracts comments
		from C source code to generate functional interface
		documentation in the same format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix
		Programmer's Manual. It requires minimal effort from the
		programmer by looking for comments in the usual places near the
		objects they document, rather than imposing a rigid
		function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
		and use a typesetting language. Acceptable documentation can
		often be generated from existing code with no modifications.
conformance:    supports both K&R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles
features:	+ generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or HTML format
		+ handles comments as part of the language grammar
		+ automagically documents enum parameter & return values
		+ handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments
		- doesn't handle C++ grammar (yet)
requires:	yacc/byacc/bison, lex/flex, and nroff/groff/texinfo/LaTeX.
ports:		Unix, OS/2, MSDOS, VMS, Amiga.
portability:	very high for unix, via Configure
status:		actively developed; contributions by users are encouraged.
discussion:	via a mailing list: send "subscribe c2man <Your Name>" (in the
		message body) to listserv@research.canon.com.au
help:		from the author and other users on the mailing list:
		c2man@research.canon.com.au
announcements:	patches appear first in comp.sources.bugs, and then in
		comp.sources.misc.
